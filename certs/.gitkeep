# At startup, `export_mkcert_root_only()` may copy the mkcert root CA
# certificate into this folder (e.g. `rootCA.pem`, `rootCA.crt`, `rootCA.cer`)
# so it can be served via the `/certs` static route and downloaded from the
# browser.
#
# Only the public mkcert root CA should ever be placed here so users can
# install/trust it on their devices.
